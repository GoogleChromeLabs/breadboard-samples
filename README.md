# Breadboard Samples

This repository contains sample code for the [Breadboard](https://github.com/google/labs-prototypes) project.

They will demonstrate how to build complex LLM applications that can be run in the browser and be used for a number of use cases such as:

- Summarizing Developer Sentiment
- Creating Bootstrapped projects (docs, code, etc)
- Merging multiple docs into a learning path

All of this code will be prototype code. It will not be production-ready. It will be used to demonstrate the capabilities of the Breadboard project.
