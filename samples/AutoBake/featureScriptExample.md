 Here is a script that can be used to teach a junior developer about the discussed topic in the documents:


# WebGPU

WebGPU is the successor to the WebGL and WebGL 2 graphics APIs for the Web. It provides modern features such as GPU compute as well as lower overhead access to GPU hardware.

## Key Concepts

- **Adapters** - Represent the underlying GPU hardware on the system. You can query for adapters and select one to create a logical GPU device.

- **Devices** - A logical GPU device created from an adapter. Manages resources like buffers and textures, and queues used to execute commands.

- **Buffers** - Blocks of memory that can be used for input/output data in GPU operations.

- **Textures** - Images that can be sampled in shaders. Can be rendered to, or populated from other images/video frames.

- **Bind Groups** - A way of making buffers and textures available to shaders. Analogous to uniform blocks in OpenGL/WebGL.

- **Pipelines** - State objects defining the shader and fixed function processing to execute. Analagous to WebGL program objects.

- **Commands** - Units of work encoded to run on the GPU device queues. Contains references to pipelines and resources. 

## Getting Started

Here is some example code to initialize WebGPU, create a pipeline, and submit a draw call:

```js
// Request a GPU device
const adapter = await navigator.gpu.requestAdapter();
const device = await adapter.requestDevice();

// Create a pipeline and encode draw command
const pipeline = device.createRenderPipeline({/*...*/});  
const commandEncoder = device.createCommandEncoder();
const passEncoder = commandEncoder.beginRenderPass({/*...*/});
passEncoder.setPipeline(pipeline);
passEncoder.draw(/*...*/);
passEncoder.endPass();

// Submit command buffer    
const commandBuffer = commandEncoder.finish();
device.queue.submit([commandBuffer]);
```

From here you can start creating more complex applications by adding buffers, textures, bind groups etc.
